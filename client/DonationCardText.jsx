      <p>
        Kitty's House is a non-profit cat rescue and retreat. We foster kittens
        until they reach adoption age. We also have senior cats who are eligible
        to be adopted into their forever home. They still have a lot of love to
        give!
      </p>
      <p>Help us continue our mission and donate to Kitty's House today.</p>
